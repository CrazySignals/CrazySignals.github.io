## More about me

* My name in Chinese is 张馨仁 . I grew up in [LanZhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanzhou), which is the only city in China where the Yellow River runs through.
* I started painting at the age of five, I love sketch and oil painting, which provide me with a means to escape from work.
* For exercise, I love running, pingpong, hiking...
* In my spare time, I enjoy writing, reading and traveling with families.<br>
These are my favorite books. 
This series of books never fails to bring me a sense of calm, and the emotional depth portrayed by the female characters never fails to resonate with me. I consider myself fortunate to have such an brilliant girlfriend in my life—she serves as both a spiritual guide and a wellspring of motivation as I navigate my journey forward.<br>
