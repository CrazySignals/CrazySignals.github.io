I am going to join the Information Hub Internet of Things Thrust at The [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/) as a Research Assistant
under the supervision of Prof. [Jiadong Yu](https://facultyprofiles.hkust-gz.edu.cn/faculty-personal-page/YU-Jiadong/jiadongyu). My research interests lie in machine learning, digital twin technologie, statistical signal processing. I obtained my master's degree in Information and Communication Engineering in Jun. 2024 at the [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Science_and_Technology_of_China), where my advisor was Prof. [Zhengyuan Xu](https://owc.ustc.edu.cn/2014/0818/c10523a116333/page.htm).
