I am a third-year master student in [Optical Wireless Communication & Network Centor](https://owc.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm), working with Prof. [Zhengyuan Xu](https://owc.ustc.edu.cn/2014/0818/c10523a116333/page.htm). My research interests lie in statistical signal processing, channel estimation and modeling and machine learning.

Research Experience
======
* Jan. 2023 – Present: Asynchronous superposition to suppress backscattering signal under the Poisson channel  
  * Evaluated the BER performance of the opposite signal at the receiving end using the HMM model combined with the Viterbi decoding algorithm by simulation.
  * Proposed a method of state transfer to further improve the communication performance of full-duplex links when the backscattering signal is known.


* Oct. 2022 – Oct. 2023: Orthogonal waveform design to suppress backscattering signal under the Gaussian channel 
  * Introduced  the orthogonal waveforms with the Hermite-Gaussian (HG) and prolate spheroidal wave function (PSWF) for a pulse position modulation based UOWC system to alleviate the backscattering effects incorporating with joint maximum likelihood detection scheme.
  * Verified the feasibility of the proposed method through experiments and discussed the corresponding communication performances under different conditions.     

* Oct. 2021 – Jan.2023: Modeling of backscattering channel for underwater optical wireless communications        
  * Proposed the photon receiving logic of Monte Carlo algorithm considering the structure of the photomultiplier tube.
  * Discussed the application scenarios for backscatter interference that need to be considered.
  * Applied the single scattering approximation to model the backscattering channel. 

Projects
======
