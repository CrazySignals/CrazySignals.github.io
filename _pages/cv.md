Research Experience
======
* Jan. 2023 – Present: Asynchronous superposition to suppress backscattering signal under the Poisson channel  
  * Evaluated the BER performance of the opposite signal at the receiving end using the HMM model combined with the Viterbi decoding algorithm by simulation.
  * In order to further improve the communication performance of full-duplex links, a method of state transfer is proposed when the backscatter signal is known.


* Oct. 2022 – Oct. 2023: Orthogonal waveform design to suppress backscattering signal under the Gaussian channel 
  * Introduced  the orthogonal waveforms with the Hermite-Gaussian (HG) and prolate spheroidal wave function (PSWF) for a pulse position modulation based UOWC system to alleviate the backscattering effects incorporating with joint maximum likelihood detection scheme.
  * Verified the feasibility of the proposed method through experiments and discussed the corresponding communication performances under different conditions.     

* Oct. 2021 – Jan.2023: Modeling of backscattering channel for underwater optical wireless communications        
  * Proposed the photon receiving logic of Monte Carlo algorithm considering the structure of the photomultiplier tube.
